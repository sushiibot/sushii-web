  personal information) owned, held, used or created by you (or on your behalf)
  that may be stored using, or processed by, our Services;

The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain to you in the clearest way
possible what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in
relation to it.

Please read this privacy policy carefully, as it will help you understand what
we do with the information that we collect.

## What information is collected

We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you
express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and
Services, when you participate in activities on the Services or otherwise when
you contact us.

Simultaneously, through our Bot, we may collect personal information related to
you that Discord provides to us through the use of the Discord API (in this
case, we refer to Discord End User Data).

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your
interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make and the products and
features you use within our Service and within the Discord servers that you
share with sushii.

By adding sushii or joining a server with sushii, the following information we
collect may include the following:

### Automatically collected data

- User ID
- Username
- Discriminator
- Avatar URL
- Date and Time of last message
- Number of messages in the past month, week, day, and in total

### Collected data only when enabled

These are only saved when a server moderator enables certain options.

- Chat messages (retained for max 7 days)
- Bans
- Mutual servers with the Bot

## How your information is used

We use personal information collected via our Services for a variety of business
purposes described below. We process your personal information for these
purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter
into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance
with our legal obligations. We use the information we collect or receive:

- **To offer our services to you.** Our Service may need your data, specifically
  obtained through the Discord API (in that case, we’re referring to Discord End
  User Data) or voluntarily and directly provided to us.
- **Request feedback.** We may use your information to request feedback and to
  contact you about your use of our Services.
- **To send administrative information to you** We may use your personal
  information to send you product, service and new feature information and/or
  information about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
- **To protect our Services.** We may use your information as part of our
  efforts to keep our Services safe and secure (for example, for fraud
  monitoring and prevention).
- **To enforce our terms, conditions and policies for business purposes, to
  comply with legal and regulatory requirements or in connection with our
  contract.**
- **To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.** If we receive a subpoena or
  other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how
  to respond.

The personal information we process may be used for the following purposes:

- **Discord ID:** We use your Discord ID to identify you among the different
  Services, and in relation to your "Discord End User Data".
- **Partial Discord Message Content:** With partial Discord message content, we
  refer to the content of messages that let you directly interact with our Bot,
  such as when using commands and keyword notifications. We use your partial
  Discord message content to provide you with the output of such commands.
- **Full Discord Message Content:** With full Discord message content, we refer
  to the full content of messages that you send using the Discord App, even when
  the message is not related to a direct interaction with our Bot. We use your
  full Discord message content to provide specific features that may be offered
  through our Bot to you, or to other users, such as Server Moderation.
- **Other Identifiers:** We may collect other types of identifiers, or contact
  details, other than your Discord ID if you are directly interacting with us;
  these identifiers will only be used to process specific inquiries, and may be
  deleted after the inquiry is complete.
- **Other Discord End User Data:** We may collect, store, and process other
  types of content you share with Discord, and that is further provided to us
  through the Discord API, to provide specific features related to our Services.

Hereafter, we also provide some additional remarks on how we process your data
in relation to some specific use cases:

- **Discord User Profile:** Your username, profile picture, and any data related to
  your Discord user profile is provided from the Discord API based on your
  Discord ID, only when needed;
- **Server Bans:** Your Discord ID may be stored in relation to the ban list of
  servers, only when opted-in.
- **Statistics:** When statistics are provided by our Services, we only keep
  aggregated and anonymized data into our database.

## How your information may be shared

**In Short:** We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to
provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business
obligations.

In general, we have no business needs that justify, nor direct interests in,
sharing your information with other entities.

We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal
basis:

- **Consent:** We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to
  use your personal information for a specific purpose.
- **Legitimate Interests:** We may process your data when it is reasonably
  necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.
- **Performance of a Contract:** Where we have entered into a contract with you,
  we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.
- **Legal Obligations:** We may disclose your information where we are legally
  required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental
  requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in
  response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public
  authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
- **Vital Interests:** We may disclose your information where we believe it is
  necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential
  violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
  threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in
  litigation in which we are involved.

## How long information is kept

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for
the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is
required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
requirements).

For messages saved for logging purposes, messages are saved for a max of 7 days
before they are removed from our database.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible
(for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## How we keep your information secure

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures
designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself
is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at
your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

Hereafter, you’ll find an exemplary and not exhaustive list of measures we
implemented to keep your data safe:

- **User Identification and Discord End User Data Processing:** Wherever
  possible, the only identification key related to you that is stored on our
  system is your "Discord ID". Your "Discord ID" is a number provided by the
  Discord API and linked to your Discord End User Data. Your username, message
  content, data you provide to Discord, etc. is accessed by requesting such data
  through the Discord API using your Discord ID, while a minimal amount of data
  is stored in our Services.
- **Encryption at Rest:** Data stored by our Services is encrypted at rest (when
  saved in our database, or any data storage media we may be using) using
  best-in-class algorithms (e.g. AES-256-GCM) and following the most diffuse
  security guidelines. In some cases, data may be encrypted through multiple
  levels of encryption using different encryption keys; this approach is applied
  to all and any custom input we receive from the Discord API related to your
  Discord message content.
- **Encryption in Transit:** Data processed by our Services, or transferred
  between different components of our infrastructure, is encrypted using
  best-in-class algorithms (e.g. TLS 1.2+ with Mutual Authentication) and
  following the most diffuse security guidelines.
- **Authentication, Authorization, Auditing:** Our Services implement security
  measures that only allow authorized users to access any stored data.
- **Infrastructure Security:** Data is segregated into different components of
  the infrastructure that provides our Services. Technical and organizational
  security measures are in place to minimize the chance of an intruder having
  access to our infrastructure.

collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If
You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us
with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected
Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental
consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.

If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information
and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's
consent before We collect and use that information.

indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective
